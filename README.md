Completed by Mike Grace

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Reverse an array without using any of Javascript's built in methods

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
For this challenge I decided to do the following:

1. set a variable to an empty array
2. set another variable to 0
3. loop backwards through the argument array
4. set the index (chosen by our set variable) of our empty array to be equal to the value of the argument array at current iteration
5. return our new array
